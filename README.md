*-**********************************ABOUT THE GAME**********************************-*

	This is a snake clicking game, your goal is to click on bouncing balls as fast as you can and eat all of them without touching the bombs!

	There are randomly placed bouncing balls in the map, some are for points and some are bombs that will end the current level and put you at the first level

	The points you earn are saved if you manage to beat the highest score, they are saved in a folder named score where the top 4 scores are stored

	The game uses IrrKlang for sounds, you can use the GUI to turn them off, there are:
		1- Background music
		2- 4 different munch sound effects when you eat a ball
		3- Heart beats as the timer gets low
		4- Winning anthem
		5- Bomb sound effect
		6- Losing song if you run out of time
	
	You can switch between first and third person by pressing on 't'
	
	Click on the balls for your snake to move to them using IKSolver animation!

	You can also use the mouse on third person to eat a ball, and use arrows to move left and right

	The higher your level, the faster the balls move!

	You can manually change the snake location/rotate its body incase you got stuck (or wanna cheat :])
